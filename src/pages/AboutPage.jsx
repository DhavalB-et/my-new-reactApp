          Hey, I’m [Your Friend’s Name]. What started as a passion for capturing
          small, candid moments soon became my full-time dream — documenting love
          stories through my camera.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of photographing countless
          weddings, engagements, and pre-wedding shoots across India. I believe
          in natural light, real emotions, and photos that make you *feel*.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not shooting, you’ll find me editing with a cup of chai in
          hand, listening to indie music, or scouting new locations for shoots.
          Let’s create something timeless together.
